            <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Gustavo Dudamel was born in 1981 in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. His father was a trombonist and his mother a voice teacher, and he grew up listening to music and conducting his toys to old recordings. He began violin lessons as a child but was drawn to conducting from an early age. At the age of 13, as a member of his youth orchestra, he put down his violin and picked up the baton when the conductor was running late</p>

            <h2>El Sistema: <em>Social justice through music</em> </h2>
            <p>El Sistema (which translates to The System) is a publicly financed, voluntary sector, music-education program, founded in Venezuela in 1975 by Venezuelan educator, musician, and activist Jos√© Antonio Abreu. The program <q>provides free classical music education that promotes human opportunity and development for impoverished children</q>. Dudamel first started in this program and would later be mentored by Jose Antonio Abreu himself.</p>
