            <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Gustavo Dudamel was born in 1981 in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. His father was a trombonist and his mother a voice teacher, and he grew up listening to music and conducting his toys to old recordings. He began violin lessons as a child but was drawn to conducting from an early age. At the age of 13, as a member of his youth orchestra, he put down his violin and picked up the baton when the conductor was running late</p>

            <h2>El Sistema: Social justice through music </h2>
            <p>El Sistema (which translates to The System) is a publicly financed, voluntary sector, music-education program, founded in Venezuela in 1975 by Venezuelan educator, musician, and activist Jos√© Antonio Abreu. The program provides free classical music education that promotes human opportunity and development for impoverished children. Dudamel first started in this program and would later be mentored by Jose Antonio Abreu himself.</p>
